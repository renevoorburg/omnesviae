            <p>OmnesViae is a route planner for the Roman Empire, entirely based on historical data sources.<br />
                The main source is a medieval copy of a (copy of) a Roman map, known as the <em>Tabula Peutingeriana</em>, showing the layout of the <em>cursus publicus</em>, the road network of the Roman Empire.
                Because the most western part of the map has been lost, the places and routes in that part of the empire have been added using the <em>Antonine Itinerary</em> (Itinerarium Antonini).
                Together, these sources provide both the possible connections between places and the distances for the calculation the shortest route.
